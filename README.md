# README

UI Playground made to create Corpogames components and tests them outside of the main app layout.

* Using Ruby and ERB logic

* Tailwind via CDN

* No Database Links so client's color themes are handled in JS

* Front has been fastly made, the goal of this tool being to focus on developping component sets coming from Figma so they can be transfered to the main app.

* More instructions to come ..
